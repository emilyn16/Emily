## Some Important Literature

-   This paper talks about the diversity of bacterial strains in the light organs of cardinal fish. \[\@gould_strain-level_2023\]

-   This paper covers the morphology of the fish and its luminescent light organ. \[\@leis1986\]

## A Cool Equation or Two

$$w_A(g) \equiv \prod_i^M \sum_j^M \Big( \frac{\exp(-q\epsilon d^H_{i,j})}{\sum_j \exp(-q\epsilon d^H_{i,j})} \Big) \phi^{d^A_{i,j}}$$
